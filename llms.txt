2. Real-time cost calculation including hidden fees
3. Automated GPU provisioning with optimal provider selection
4. HuggingFace Spaces one-click deployment
5. Kubernetes and Helm template generation
6. Cost tracking and budget management
7. Telemetry and usage analytics

terradev quote -g A100

# Provision optimal GPU instance
terradev provision -g H100 --duration 8

# Deploy to HuggingFace Spaces
terradev hf-space my-model --model-id meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf

# Check system status
terradev status
```

## 🐳 DOCKER INTEGRATION
```bash
# Pull Docker image
docker pull theoddden/terradev:2.9.2

# Run with cloud credentials
docker run --rm \
  -v ~/.aws:/home/terradev/.aws:ro \
  theoddden/terradev:2.9.2 \
  python -m terradev_cli quote -g A100

# Docker Compose setup
docker-compose up terradev-cli
```

## 📓 JUPYTER INTEGRATION
```python
# Install with Jupyter support
pip install terradev-cli[jupyter]==2.9.2

# Use in notebooks
import subprocess
result = subprocess.run(['python', '-m', 'terradev_cli', 'quote', '-g', 'A100'], 
                       capture_output=True, text=True)
print(result.stdout)
```

## ⚡ GITHUB ACTIONS
```yaml
- name: Optimize GPU Costs
  uses: theoddden/terradev@v2.9.2
